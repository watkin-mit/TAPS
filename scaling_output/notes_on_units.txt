Units in files:

em_CEDS.csv, em_GFED.csv, Emissions_components.csv (Inventory): 
Tg of emissions. OC, BC, and NMVOC species are expressed as Tg C. 

Emissions_scenarios.csv: 
Same, with NO expressed as Tg NO2 for comparison with McDuffie et al. (2020)

fuel_proportions.csv: 
Proportion (0 to 1) of sectoral emissions from each CEDS_GBD-MAPS fuel category.

TableA1.csv: 
Percent (0 to 100) of sectoral emissions from each CEDS_GBD-MAPS fuel category.

GAINSEMFEFs.csv, GAINSNH3EFs.csv:
Raw emission factors in kt emissions per production activity (in joules, tonnes, or quantities of livestock).
Production activity units are given in GAINSEMF_sectoral_mapping.csv and CEDS_GAINSNH3_sectoral_mapping.csv.

CEDS_scaling.csv, GFED_scaling.csv, GAINS_EFs_by_EPPA_region.csv, GAINSEF_Fits.csv, Emissions_components.csv (Activity and Intensity): 
Relative trends (where a value of 1 reflects the base year value) for scaling.
